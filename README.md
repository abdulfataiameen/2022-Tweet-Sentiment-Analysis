# Situation:
The tweet sentiment analysis project was carried out to analyze tweets from 2022 and determine the overall sentiment of the tweets. The analysis aimed to provide insights into the overall sentiment of Twitter users in 2022, as well as the most commonly used adjectives in the tweets.


# Task:
To perform the tweet sentiment analysis, the following tasks were carried out:

- Authenticating with the Twitter API and searching for tweets containing a specified search query.
- Writing the tweet data to a CSV file using the csv library.
- Loading the tweet data from the CSV file into a dataframe and preprocessing the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters using the pandas library.
- Performing sentiment analysis on the tweet text and creating a new column in the dataframe containing the sentiment results using the TextBlob library.
- Creating a bar plot of the adjective frequencies in the tweet text using the seaborn library.
- Creating a word cloud of the adjectives using the matplotlib library.
- Creating a histogram of the sentiment results to visualize the distribution of the sentiment scores using the matplotlib library.
- Masking the API keys when sharing the code on GitHub using the python-decouple library.


# Actions:
The following actions were taken to perform the tweet sentiment analysis:

1. Authenticating with the Twitter API: The tweepy library was used to authenticate with the Twitter API and search for tweets containing a specified search query.
2. Writing the tweet data to a CSV file: The csv library was used to write the tweet data to a CSV file.
3. Loading the tweet data into a dataframe and preprocessing the text data: The pandas library was used to load the tweet data from the CSV file into a dataframe and preprocess the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters.
4. Performing sentiment analysis: The TextBlob library was used to perform sentiment analysis on the tweet text and create a new column in the dataframe containing the sentiment results.
5. Creating a bar plot of the adjective frequencies: The seaborn library was used to create a bar plot of the adjective frequencies in the tweet text.
6. Creating a word cloud of the adjectives: The matplotlib library was used to create a word cloud of the adjectives.
7. Creating a histogram of the sentiment results: The matplotlib library was used to create a histogram of the sentiment results to visualize the distribution of the sentiment scores.
8. Masking the API keys: The python-decouple library was used to mask the API keys when sharing the code on GitHub.

### Tools Used:
The following tools were used to perform the tweet sentiment analysis:

1. Tweepy: Used for authenticating with the Twitter API and searching for tweets.
2. Pandas: Used to load the tweet data into a dataframe and preprocess the text data.
3. TextBlob: Used to perform sentiment analysis on the tweet text.
4. Seaborn: Used to create a bar plot of the adjective frequencies in the tweet text.
5. Matplotlib: Used to create a word cloud of the adjectives, create a histogram of the sentiment results, and mask the API keys when sharing the code on GitHub.
6. Python-Decouple: Used to mask the API keys when sharing the code on GitHub.


# Results:
The following results were obtained from the tweet sentiment analysis:

- The sentiment analysis revealed that the overall sentiment of the tweets was positive, with a mean sentiment score of 0.4.
- The most commonly used adjectives in the tweets were "great," "good," "amazing," "happy," and "fun."
- The bar plot of the adjective frequencies showed that "great" was the most commonly
